  Play N Learn is an iOS App created using Xcode with programming language Swift. This app is created to help young children of age group 2-4 years learn a variety of skills in a fun and engaging way. This app is created as a school project for our course while learning about Swift and SwiftUI. This app was built following scrum practice with a weekly sprint review. This application consists of four small games such as : number game, colour game, shape game & a xylophone .Users can choose the game from the settings. The application has two play modes : touch & voice
